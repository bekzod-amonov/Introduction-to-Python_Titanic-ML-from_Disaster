Introduction
------------

Welcome to the Titanic Survival Prediction Package documentation. This package is designed to facilitate the development and evaluation of machine learning models to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic. It provides tools for data preprocessing, feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, model training, and evaluation, as well as utilities for generating submission files.


Features
------------


Data Preprocessing
---------------------

Functions for loading datasets and preparing them for analysis by filling missing values, dropping unnecessary columns, and encoding categorical variables.

Feature Engineering
---------------------

Tools for creating and selecting features that improve model performance.

Hyperparameter Tuning
---------------------

Utilities for tuning model hyperparameters using grid search and random search methods.

Predictor
-----------

Functions for making predictions with trained models and generating submission files.
